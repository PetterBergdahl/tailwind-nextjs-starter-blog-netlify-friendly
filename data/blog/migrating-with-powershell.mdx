## Overview

Migrating content between tenants in SharePoint can often be a big hassle, and require expensive tools in the process. 
What if you just want to copy content from a specific site, such as pages, documents and other assets. For this, we can use PnP Powershell. 

PnP Powershell is very powerful and can be used to do a multitude of tasks. But for this blog post, lets focus on the simple objective of copying content.
If you want to move the content from tenant A to B, you can do this directly in Powershell, but the client wanted to extract the content to their local storage for a later migration.

Here's the script in its entirety:


```jsx
$SourceSiteURL = "https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>"

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SourceSiteURL -Interactive
 
$TempFile = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()
 
Get-PnPSiteTemplate -Out C:\<path>\template.xml -Handlers PageContents -IncludeAllClientSidePages -Force -PersistBrandingFiles
```

And in the same way, heres the script to upload the content to another site or tenant:

```jsx
$DestinationSiteURL = "https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>"

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $DestinationSiteURL -Interactive
 
Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate -Path C:\Scripts\template.xml
```
The same principle can be applied for copying termgroups, navigation, permission groups etc. Read more about it in the link below:
