## Overview

Migrating content between tenants in SharePoint can often be a big hassle, and require expensive tools in the process. 
What if you just want to copy content from a specific site, such as pages, documents and other assets? For this, we can use PnP Powershell. 

PnP Powershell is a very useful set of cmdlets and can be used to do a multitude of tasks in Microsoft 365. But for this blog post, lets focus on the simple objective of copying, or rather extracting and importing, content.
If you want to move the content from tenant A to B, you can do this directly in one operation in Powershell, but the client wanted to extract the content to their local storage for a later migration.

Here's the script for extracting data in its entirety:


```jsx
$SourceSiteURL = "https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>"

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SourceSiteURL -Interactive
 
$TempFile = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()
 
Get-PnPSiteTemplate -Out C:\<folder>\template.xml -Handlers PageContents -IncludeAllClientSidePages -Force -PersistBrandingFiles
```

And in the same way, heres the script to upload the content to another site or tenant:

```jsx
$DestinationSiteURL = "https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>"

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $DestinationSiteURL -Interactive
 
Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate -Path C:\<folder>\template.xml
```

The cmdlets we are using in these examples are Get-PnPSiteTemplate/Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate.
They can also be applied for copying termgroups, navigation, permission groups etc. Read more about it in the link below:
